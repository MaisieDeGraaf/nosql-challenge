## UK Food Establishment Data Analysis

This project involves the analysis of UK food establishment data using MongoDB and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to perform data analysis on UK food establishment data stored in MongoDB. The data includes information such as business names, addresses, hygiene scores, and more. The analysis involves querying, updating, and visualizing the data using Python and MongoDB.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two Jupyter Notebooks:

- NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb: This notebook covers the initial setup steps, including importing the data into MongoDB, querying and updating the database, and converting data types.
  
- NoSQL_Analysis_Starter.ipynb: This notebook focuses on data analysis tasks, including querying for specific criteria, creating pipelines, and visualizing the results.

## Setup Instructions

1. Installation: Ensure you have MongoDB installed on your system. If not, follow the official MongoDB installation guide for your operating system.

2. Importing Data: Run the provided mongoimport command in the Terminal to import the establishments.json file into MongoDB.

3. Jupyter Notebooks: Open the Jupyter Notebooks (NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb and NoSQL_Analysis_Starter.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Dependencies: Make sure you have the required Python dependencies installed, including pymongo, pandas, and pprint. You can install them using pip:

5. Run Notebooks: Execute the cells in the notebooks sequentially to perform the data analysis tasks.
